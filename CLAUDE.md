# Claude Code Configuration for Claude Flow

## üö® CRITICAL: PARALLEL EXECUTION AFTER SWARM INIT

**MANDATORY RULE**: Once swarm is initialized with memory, ALL subsequent operations MUST be parallel:

1. **TodoWrite** ‚Üí Always batch 5-10+ todos in ONE call
2. **Task spawning** ‚Üí Spawn ALL agents in ONE message
3. **File operations** ‚Üí Batch ALL reads/writes together
4. **NEVER** operate sequentially after swarm init

## üö® CRITICAL: CONCURRENT EXECUTION FOR ALL ACTIONS

**ABSOLUTE RULE**: ALL operations MUST be concurrent/parallel in a single message:

### üî¥ MANDATORY CONCURRENT PATTERNS:

1. **TodoWrite**: ALWAYS batch ALL todos in ONE call (5-10+ todos minimum)
2. **Task tool**: ALWAYS spawn ALL agents in ONE message with full instructions
3. **File operations**: ALWAYS batch ALL reads/writes/edits in ONE message
4. **Bash commands**: ALWAYS batch ALL terminal operations in ONE message
5. **Memory operations**: ALWAYS batch ALL memory store/retrieve in ONE message

### ‚ö° GOLDEN RULE: "1 MESSAGE = ALL RELATED OPERATIONS"

**Examples of CORRECT concurrent execution:**

```javascript
// ‚úÖ CORRECT: Everything in ONE message
[Single Message]:
  - TodoWrite { todos: [10+ todos with all statuses/priorities] }
  - Task("Agent 1 with full instructions and hooks")
  - Task("Agent 2 with full instructions and hooks")
  - Task("Agent 3 with full instructions and hooks")
  - Read("file1.js")
  - Read("file2.js")
  - Read("file3.js")
  - Write("output1.js", content)
  - Write("output2.js", content)
  - Bash("npm install")
  - Bash("npm test")
  - Bash("npm run build")
```

**Examples of WRONG sequential execution:**

```javascript
// ‚ùå WRONG: Multiple messages (NEVER DO THIS)
Message 1: TodoWrite { todos: [single todo] }
Message 2: Task("Agent 1")
Message 3: Task("Agent 2")
Message 4: Read("file1.js")
Message 5: Write("output1.js")
Message 6: Bash("npm install")
// This is 6x slower and breaks coordination!
```

### üéØ CONCURRENT EXECUTION CHECKLIST:

Before sending ANY message, ask yourself:

- ‚úÖ Are ALL related TodoWrite operations batched together?
- ‚úÖ Are ALL Task spawning operations in ONE message?
- ‚úÖ Are ALL file operations (Read/Write/Edit) batched together?
- ‚úÖ Are ALL bash commands grouped in ONE message?
- ‚úÖ Are ALL memory operations concurrent?

If ANY answer is "No", you MUST combine operations into a single message!

## Package Management Guidelines

- When dealing with Python, always install packages through uv or pyproject.toml. Never use pip. 
- After using uv or pyproject.toml to add or remove packages, don't run uv sync. 
- We will use nix and uv2nix to actually install the packages and set up our venv, so we will deal with that outside of pip.
