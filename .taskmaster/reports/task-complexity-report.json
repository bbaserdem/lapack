			"taskTitle": "Phase 1: Analysis - Understand LAPACK structure, CMake build, and LAPACKE interface",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand each existing subtask to include specific actions, tools, and expected outputs. For example, detail the specific CMake commands to analyze, the exact header files to review, and the format of the documentation to be created.",
			"reasoning": "The task involves understanding a large codebase and build system. While the existing subtasks are a good start, they lack granular detail. More subtasks will ensure a thorough analysis."

		{
			"taskId": 15,
			"taskTitle": "Phase 2: Setup - Create Rust crate structure with Cargo.toml and build.rs",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the `build.rs` creation and configuration into smaller steps, detailing the specific commands and configurations needed for cbindgen and linking. Add subtasks for testing the build process at each stage.",
			"reasoning": "Setting up the Rust crate structure with FFI requires careful configuration. More subtasks focused on the build process and testing will reduce potential errors."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 16,
			"taskTitle": "Phase 3: FFI Generation - Configure bindgen to generate bindings from lapacke.h",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 9,
			"expansionPrompt": "Detail the specific bindgen configurations needed (e.g., include paths, blocklists, wrapper generation). Add subtasks for handling different data types and function signatures in LAPACKE. Include steps for verifying the generated bindings with simple test cases.",
			"reasoning": "Generating FFI bindings with bindgen can be complex, especially with a large library like LAPACK. More subtasks will ensure proper configuration and validation of the bindings."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 17,
			"taskTitle": "Phase 4: Safe API - Design and implement safe Rust wrapper types and functions",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the subtasks to include specific design decisions for the `Matrix` and `Vector` types (e.g., memory layout, ownership). Add subtasks for handling different data types (e.g., `f32`, `f64`, `Complex<f64>`). Include steps for testing the safe API with property-based testing.",
			"reasoning": "Designing a safe and efficient Rust API around raw FFI bindings is challenging. More subtasks will ensure proper memory management, error handling, and type safety."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 18,
			"taskTitle": "Phase 5: Integration - Integrate Rust build into LAPACK's CMake system",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Detail the specific CMake commands and configurations needed to integrate the Rust build. Add subtasks for handling different build environments and dependencies. Include steps for testing the integration with different CMake options.",
			"reasoning": "Integrating the Rust build into LAPACK's CMake system requires careful configuration. More subtasks will ensure proper integration and compatibility with different build environments."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 19,
			"taskTitle": "Phase 6: Testing - Port key LAPACK tests to Rust and ensure correctness",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the subtasks to include specific test cases for different LAPACK routines. Add subtasks for handling different data types and matrix properties. Include steps for analyzing the performance of the Rust implementation and identifying potential bottlenecks.",
			"reasoning": "Thorough testing is crucial for ensuring the correctness and performance of the Rust bindings. More subtasks will ensure comprehensive test coverage and performance analysis."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 20,
			"taskTitle": "Phase 7: Documentation - Write Rust API docs and integration guide",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the documentation tasks into smaller steps, detailing the specific information to be included in each document. Add subtasks for reviewing and editing the documentation to ensure clarity and accuracy. Include steps for generating and publishing the documentation.",
			"reasoning": "Comprehensive documentation is essential for the usability and maintainability of the Rust bindings. More subtasks will ensure that the documentation is complete, accurate, and easy to understand."
