			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 10,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose each SpMV and element access routine into smaller, testable units, such as data structure manipulation, index calculations, and error handling. For DSPSET, detail the reallocation strategy.",
			"reasoning": "Implementing SpMV for different formats and element access requires careful attention to data structures and algorithms. Reallocation in DSPSET adds complexity. While subtasks exist, further decomposition will improve testability and manageability."

			"taskTitle": "Phase 4: Testing and Integration - Validation and Build System",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 12,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the testing tasks into specific test cases for each conversion routine and SpMV verification. Detail the steps for integrating the sparse module into the LAPACK build system, including dependency management and installation rules.",
			"reasoning": "Testing and integration are complex due to the need for thorough validation and compatibility with the existing LAPACK build system. The existing subtasks are high-level; more granular subtasks are needed for effective tracking and execution."

			"taskTitle": "Phase 5: Advanced Features - Matrix Operations and Optimization",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 12,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose each advanced matrix operation and optimization utility into smaller, manageable units, focusing on algorithm implementation, memory management, and performance tuning. Detail the steps for handling different sparsity patterns and edge cases.",
			"reasoning": "Implementing advanced sparse matrix operations and optimization utilities is highly complex, requiring deep understanding of sparse matrix algorithms and performance considerations. The existing subtasks are too broad and need further refinement."

			"taskId": 13,
			"taskTitle": "Phase 6: Extended Precision - Multi-precision Support",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 10,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the porting process for each precision (single, complex, double complex) into smaller, testable units, focusing on data type conversions, numerical stability considerations, and testing. Detail the documentation requirements for each precision.",
			"reasoning": "Porting to multiple precisions requires careful attention to data type conversions, numerical stability, and testing. While the existing subtasks cover the main precisions, further decomposition is needed to manage the complexity of each porting effort."
