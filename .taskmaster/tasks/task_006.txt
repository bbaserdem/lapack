# Task ID: 6
# Title: Create Documentation and Examples
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: low
# Description: Create documentation and examples for common use cases, document the graph schema structure, provide Neo4j query examples, and write a usage guide for the command-line tool.
# Details:
1. Create example scripts for common use cases, such as parsing a single file, building a dependency graph, and exporting to different formats.
2. Document the graph schema structure, including node and relationship types, properties, and constraints.
3. Provide Neo4j query examples for common tasks, such as finding all routines that call a specific function or identifying all files that define a specific routine.
4. Write a usage guide for the command-line tool, including installation instructions, command-line options, and examples.

# Test Strategy:
Review the documentation for completeness and clarity. Ensure that the examples are easy to understand and follow. Verify that the Neo4j query examples are correct and efficient. Test the command-line tool with different options and inputs to ensure that it works as expected.
