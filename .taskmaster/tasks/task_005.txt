# Task ID: 5
# Title: Perform Integration Testing
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Perform integration testing by parsing multiple related LAPACK files, building complete dependency graphs, and testing with different routine types. Verify cross-file dependency resolution.
# Details:
1. Parse multiple related LAPACK files using the `FortranParser`.
2. Build complete dependency graphs from the parsed files.
3. Test with different routine types (BLAS Level 1, 2, 3, LAPACK solvers).
4. Verify cross-file dependency resolution by ensuring that dependencies between files are correctly identified and represented in the graph.

# Test Strategy:
Create integration tests that parse multiple LAPACK files and build dependency graphs. Verify that all dependencies are correctly resolved, including cross-file dependencies. Test with different routine types to ensure comprehensive coverage. Use a Neo4j database to visualize and validate the generated graphs.
