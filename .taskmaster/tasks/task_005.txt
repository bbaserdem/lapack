# Task ID: 5
# Title: Perform Integration Testing
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2, 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Perform integration testing by parsing multiple related LAPACK files, building complete dependency graphs, and testing with different routine types. Verify cross-file dependency resolution.
# Details:
1. Parse multiple related LAPACK files using the `FortranParser`.
2. Build complete dependency graphs from the parsed files.
3. Test with different routine types (BLAS Level 1, 2, 3, LAPACK solvers).
4. Verify cross-file dependency resolution by ensuring that dependencies between files are correctly identified and represented in the graph.

# Test Strategy:
Create integration tests that parse multiple LAPACK files and build dependency graphs. Verify that all dependencies are correctly resolved, including cross-file dependencies. Test with different routine types to ensure comprehensive coverage. Use a Neo4j database to visualize and validate the generated graphs.

Successfully created comprehensive integration tests in test_integration_enhanced.py that test parsing multiple LAPACK files (BLAS Level 1, 2, 3 and LAPACK solvers), build complete dependency graphs, and verify cross-file dependencies. All 7 tests are passing.

## 2. Test cross-file dependency resolution [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Verify that calls between routines in different files are properly tracked
### Details:
<info added on 2025-07-25T17:45:26.471Z>
Implemented comprehensive cross-file dependency resolution tests. Tests verify that LAPACK routines correctly reference BLAS routines from different files, handle missing dependencies gracefully, and properly track all call relationships across file boundaries. The enhanced test suite includes 7 comprehensive test methods covering different routine types and dependency scenarios.
