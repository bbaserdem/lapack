# Task ID: 4
# Title: Implement and Test Export Formats
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement and test the export functionality for JSON, CSV, and Cypher formats. Ensure all formats preserve data integrity and are suitable for visualization tools and Neo4j import.
# Details:
1. Implement JSON export for visualization tools.
2. Implement CSV export for neo4j-admin bulk import.
3. Implement Cypher statement generation for direct Neo4j import.
4. Ensure all formats preserve data integrity by correctly mapping AST data to the export formats.
```python
class Exporter:
    def __init__(self, graph):
        self.graph = graph

    def to_json(self, filepath):
        # Export graph to JSON format
        pass

    def to_csv(self, filepath):
        # Export graph to CSV format
        pass

    def to_cypher(self, filepath):
        # Generate Cypher statements for graph import
        pass
```

# Test Strategy:
Create unit tests for each export format. Verify that the exported data matches the expected format and content. Test JSON export with visualization tools. Test CSV export with neo4j-admin. Validate Cypher statements by importing them into a Neo4j database. Compare the original data with the imported data to ensure integrity.
