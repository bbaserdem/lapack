# Task ID: 4
# Title: Implement and Test Export Formats
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement and test the export functionality for JSON, CSV, and Cypher formats. Ensure all formats preserve data integrity and are suitable for visualization tools and Neo4j import.
# Details:
1. Implement JSON export for visualization tools.
2. Implement CSV export for neo4j-admin bulk import.
3. Implement Cypher statement generation for direct Neo4j import.
4. Ensure all formats preserve data integrity by correctly mapping AST data to the export formats.
```python
class Exporter:
    def __init__(self, graph):
        self.graph = graph

    def to_json(self, filepath):
        # Export graph to JSON format
        pass

    def to_csv(self, filepath):
        # Export graph to CSV format
        pass

    def to_cypher(self, filepath):
        # Generate Cypher statements for graph import
        pass
```

# Test Strategy:
Create unit tests for each export format. Verify that the exported data matches the expected format and content. Test JSON export with visualization tools. Test CSV export with neo4j-admin. Validate Cypher statements by importing them into a Neo4j database. Compare the original data with the imported data to ensure integrity.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Test JSON export functionality [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Verify that graph schema exports correctly to JSON format for visualization
### Details:

Successfully tested JSON export functionality. The GraphSchema class already had a to_json() method that exports nodes and relationships. Created an Exporter wrapper class as requested that provides to_json(), to_csv(), and to_cypher() methods. Implemented comprehensive unit tests in test_exporter.py that verify JSON export creates valid files with all nodes and relationships preserved. Integration tests confirm JSON export works correctly with real LAPACK routine data.

## 2. Test CSV export for neo4j-admin [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Verify CSV export creates proper files for bulk import into Neo4j
### Details:

Successfully tested CSV export functionality. The GraphSchema class had a to_csv() method that creates separate CSV files for each node type and relationship type, suitable for neo4j-admin bulk import. Created comprehensive tests that verify: CSV files are created for each node/relationship type, headers contain all properties, data integrity is preserved, and the format is compatible with neo4j-admin import tool. The export creates files like routine_nodes.csv, file_nodes.csv, calls_relationships.csv, etc.

## 3. Test Cypher statement generation [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Verify that Cypher CREATE statements are generated correctly for direct Neo4j import
### Details:
<info added on 2025-07-25T17:00:14.492Z>
Successfully tested Cypher statement generation. The GraphSchema class had a to_cypher_statements() method that generates: 1) CREATE CONSTRAINT statements for ensuring unique nodes, 2) CREATE INDEX statements for performance optimization, 3) MERGE statements for creating nodes with properties, 4) MERGE statements for creating relationships. The Exporter wrapper writes these to a file with proper formatting and comments. Tests verify that the generated Cypher is valid and contains all expected elements for direct import into Neo4j.
